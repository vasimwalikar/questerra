									<strong>Architecture Trip</strong>
								</h2>
								<p>Recognize the Architect within You</p>
								<p>The quaint little cottages nestled in the hill-stations, the intricately carved temples, the grand palaces or the skyscrapers that dot the skyline have you ever wondered how they got there? They all start out as the vision of the Architect. The vision takes the form of a rough sketch after which the planning phase kicks in before the actual construction of the building. The development of Architecture marks the progression of mankind. The primal influence on Indian Architecture is its History. </p>
								<p>A Quest itinerary would transcend you into that vision of the architect and spin your journey around the iconic monuments of each era. Studying the Architectural practices during different phases of Indian History will ignite your curiosity and add passion in your everyday professional life. From the dawn of time, dating back to the pre-historic era Indian Architecture has left its impressions on the curious mind. Unpeeling the layers from the very beginning of Indian History from pre historic times to contemporary architecture we have tried to cover it all. </p>

								<p>The quaint little cottages nestled in the hill-stations, the intricately carved temples, the grand palaces or the skyscrapers that dot the skyline have you ever wondered how they got there? They all start out as the vision of the Architect. The vision takes the form of a rough sketch after which the planning phase kicks in before the actual construction of the building. The development of Architecture marks the progression of mankind. The primal influence on Indian Architecture is its History. </p>
